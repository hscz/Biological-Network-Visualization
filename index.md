# Welcome to Visualization Lab 
GML is a novel grid-layout algorithm that aims to clarify the network complexity according to its inherent modular structure. With the method of module-layout, GML optimizes the locations of modules to reduce visual complications effectively and is particularly suitable for visualizations of complex biological networks with modular feature.
